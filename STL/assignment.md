# C++ Templates and STL Practice Assignment

## Part 1: Function Templates

1. Write a function template `swap_values` that can swap two values of any type.

2. Create a function template `find_max` that returns the maximum of three values of any comparable type.

3. Implement a function template `print_array` that can print arrays of any type and any size.

## Part 2: Class Templates

4. Design a class template `Stack` that implements a basic stack data structure. Include methods for push, pop, top, and isEmpty.

5. Create a class template `Pair` that can store two values of different types. Implement methods to get and set these values.

6. Implement a class template `CircularBuffer` with a fixed size. Include methods to add elements, get elements, and check if the buffer is full or empty.

## Part 3: STL Containers

7. Use `std::vector` to store a list of integers. Implement functions to:
   - Add elements to the vector
   - Remove elements from the vector
   - Sort the vector
   - Find an element in the vector

8. Create a program that uses `std::map` to store and retrieve student grades (student name as key, grade as value).

9. Implement a program that uses `std::set` to store unique words from a given text input.

## Part 4: STL Algorithms

10. Use `std::find_if` to find the first even number in a `std::vector` of integers.

11. Implement a program that uses `std::sort` with a custom comparator to sort a `std::vector` of custom objects.

12. Use `std::transform` to convert a `std::vector` of lowercase strings to uppercase.

## Part 5: Putting it All Together

13. Create a template class `DataAnalyzer` that can work with different types of data (e.g., int, float, double). Implement methods to:
    - Add data to a container (use an appropriate STL container)
    - Calculate the average of the data
    - Find the minimum and maximum values
    - Sort the data

14. Write a program that reads a text file, counts the occurrence of each word using `std::map`, and then uses STL algorithms to find the top N most frequent words.

Remember to compile and test your code for each exercise. Good luck!
